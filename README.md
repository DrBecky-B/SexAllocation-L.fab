# SexAllocation-L.fab
This repository contains data, code and information about an experiment which tests whether Lysiphlebus fabarum females allocate sex according to LMC theory. Also included are photos of wings and measurements to test whether offspring size varies according to founders number (LMC), sex or emergence time.

I've made changes directly into github to practice pulling.
